****🚀 SQL & MongoDB: HR Analytics for Employee Attrition & Performance**

I recently worked on an HR Analytics project focused on Employee Attrition & Performance using SQL and MongoDB, where I analyzed key workforce trends to support data-driven decision-making. This project aimed to identify the factors influencing employee retention, performance, and overall workforce efficiency.

🔹 Project Overview:
The objective was to design a robust database system that could handle both structured (SQL) and unstructured (MongoDB) data for deeper analysis of employee behavior, attrition trends, and performance metrics.

📌 Key Contributions & Techniques Used:
✅ Data Modeling & Database Design:

Created a relational database model and built the physical database in SQL Server.
Designed a document-based structure in MongoDB for storing flexible HR data.
✅ Data Processing & ETL:

Loaded structured HR datasets into SQL and unstructured employee records into MongoDB.
Used SQL queries to clean, filter, and preprocess data for analysis.
Managed data ingestion into MongoDB, ensuring scalability for future workforce insights.
✅ Query Development & Analysis:

Wrote complex SQL queries to analyze employee attrition rates, department-wise turnover, and performance metrics.
Developed MongoDB queries to retrieve employee data efficiently from a NoSQL database.
Identified key trends such as attrition causes, tenure impact on retention, and department-based turnover rates.
✅ Business Insights & Reporting:

Generated interactive reports to highlight attrition drivers, employee satisfaction levels, and workforce trends.
Provided data-backed recommendations to HR teams for improving employee engagement and reducing turnover.
🎯 Key Outcomes:
✔ Identified high-risk attrition groups based on department, tenure, and performance scores.
✔ Provided insights into workforce trends, helping HR teams make data-driven retention strategies.
✔ Strengthened expertise in SQL database design, MongoDB data modeling, and HR analytics.

💡 This project reinforced my skills in database management, query optimization, and analytical problem-solving, bridging the gap between structured and unstructured data for actionable business insights.

🔍 Excited to apply these skills to real-world workforce analytics challenges!
